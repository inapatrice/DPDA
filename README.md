# Deterministic Pushdown Automata (DPDA) Project
A deterministic pushdown automata (DPDA) accepts deterministic context - free languages - where there will be at most one transition from any state based on the input given. The goal of this project is to design and implement a deterministic push - down automata that can recognize a specific context free language L. L is defined as L = {a^nb^n | n >= 0}. To put this into simpler terms, the language has to have an equal number of a’s and b’s where the a’s must come first before the b’s.
